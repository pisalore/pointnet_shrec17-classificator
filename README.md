# Geometric Textures Classificator using Pointnet
Experiments on pointnet capability to detect and recognize geometric patterns.

After the test of pointnet over geometric textures segmentation using the segmentation module, the new purpose is to verify pointnet accuracy in classifying geometric textures.
